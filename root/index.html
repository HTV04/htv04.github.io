<p>Welcome. Things are a little WIP around these parts, but everything
great starts off somewhere, right?</p>
<p>…CSS? What’s that?</p>
<h2 id="me.">Me.</h2>
<p>My name is Harrison. I’m currently 19 years old, and I live in the
United States. I have many hobbies, but my favorite by far is software
development. Why? Honestly, I’m not too sure. I just really like working
on software. The best way I can describe it is that it’s like solving a
complicated puzzle, but the result is something way more rewarding than
a picture.</p>
<p>I also have a knack for reverse engineering and “hacking.” I’m not a
l33t haxx0r or anything, but I do have an interest in checking out the
internals of some of my favorite projects or hardware, and incorporating
my own stuff into them.</p>
<p>Finally, I’m a huge Linux and OSS enthusiast. Wherever I can, I run
Linux (i use arch linux btw). I also make sure all the software I
develop can run on Linux, and occasionally help port software over to
Linux. I’m actually in a Linux user group at my university. My goal in
that group is to help people learn more about Linux and consider using
it as their main OS.</p>
<p>…In other words, I’m a huge nerd. LOL</p>

<p><marquee>BREAKING NEWS: Local Programmer Struggles With Web
Development In a tech-savvy world where web development skills are
highly sought after, one local programmer is facing challenges as they
transition from native development to web development. The unnamed
programmer, who primarily has experience in native app development,
finds themselves grappling with the complexities of web development.
According to sources close to the programmer, the transition has been
met with frustration and a steep learning curve. “They’re used to
working with compiled languages and developing for specific platforms,”
said one colleague. “But web development requires a different mindset
and skill set altogether.” The programmer’s struggle is not uncommon in
an industry where technologies and frameworks are constantly evolving.
With the rapid pace of change, even seasoned developers can find
themselves struggling to keep up. One of the main hurdles for the
programmer has been understanding the intricacies of front-end
development, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. While they may be
proficient in programming languages like C++ or Rust, the nuances of web
technologies present a new set of challenges. Additionally, the
programmer is navigating the vast ecosystem of web development tools and
frameworks, such as React. With so many options available, it can be
overwhelming to determine which ones are best suited for their projects.
Despite the challenges, the programmer remains determined to master web
development. “I know it’s a steep learning curve, but I’m committed to
expanding my skill set and becoming proficient in web development,” said
the programmer. “I believe that with dedication and perseverance, I’ll
be able to overcome these challenges and excel in this new domain.” As
the demand for web developers continues to grow, the programmer’s
journey serves as a reminder of the importance of adaptability and
continuous learning in the ever-changing field of technology. With
determination and the right resources, they are well-positioned to
overcome their struggles and thrive in their new role as a web
developer.</marquee></p>
