## Welcome.
Things are a little WIP around these parts, but everything great starts off somewhere, right?

## Me.
My name is Harrison. I'm currently 20 years old, and I live in the United States. I have many hobbies, but my favorite by far is software development. Why? Honestly, I'm not too sure. I just really like working on software. The best way I can describe it is that it's like solving a complicated puzzle, but the result is something way more rewarding than a picture.

I also have a knack for reverse engineering and "hacking." I'm not a l33t haxx0r or anything, but I do have an interest in checking out the internals of some of my favorite projects or hardware, and incorporating my own stuff into them.

Finally, I'm a huge Linux and OSS enthusiast. Wherever I can, I run Linux (i use arch linux btw). I also make sure all the software I develop can run on Linux, and occasionally help port software over to Linux. I'm actually in a Linux user group at my university. My goal in that group is to help people learn more about Linux and consider using it as their main OS.

...In other words, I'm a huge nerd. LOL
