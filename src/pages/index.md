Welcome. Things are a little WIP around these parts, but everything great starts off somewhere, right?

...CSS? What's that?

## Me.
My name is Harrison. I'm currently 19 years old, and I live in the United States. I have many hobbies, but my favorite by far is software development. Why? Honestly, I'm not too sure. I just really like working on software. The best way I can describe it is that it's like solving a complicated puzzle, but the result is something way more rewarding than a picture.

I also have a knack for reverse engineering and "hacking." I'm not a l33t haxx0r or anything, but I do have an interest in checking out the internals of some of my favorite projects or hardware, and incorporating my own stuff into them.

Finally, I'm a huge Linux and OSS enthusiast. Wherever I can, I run Linux (i use arch linux btw). I also make sure all the software I develop can run on Linux, and occasionally help port software over to Linux. I'm actually in a Linux user group at my university. My goal in that group is to help people learn more about Linux and consider using it as their main OS.

...In other words, I'm a huge nerd. LOL

## Projects.

<marquee>BREAKING NEWS: Local Programmer Struggles With Web Development In a tech-savvy world where web development skills are highly sought after, one local programmer is facing challenges as they transition from native development to web development. The unnamed programmer, who primarily has experience in native app development, finds themselves grappling with the complexities of web development. According to sources close to the programmer, the transition has been met with frustration and a steep learning curve. "They're used to working with compiled languages and developing for specific platforms," said one colleague. "But web development requires a different mindset and skill set altogether." The programmer's struggle is not uncommon in an industry where technologies and frameworks are constantly evolving. With the rapid pace of change, even seasoned developers can find themselves struggling to keep up. One of the main hurdles for the programmer has been understanding the intricacies of front-end development, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. While they may be proficient in programming languages like C++ or Rust, the nuances of web technologies present a new set of challenges. Additionally, the programmer is navigating the vast ecosystem of web development tools and frameworks, such as React. With so many options available, it can be overwhelming to determine which ones are best suited for their projects. Despite the challenges, the programmer remains determined to master web development. "I know it's a steep learning curve, but I'm committed to expanding my skill set and becoming proficient in web development," said the programmer. "I believe that with dedication and perseverance, I'll be able to overcome these challenges and excel in this new domain." As the demand for web developers continues to grow, the programmer's journey serves as a reminder of the importance of adaptability and continuous learning in the ever-changing field of technology. With determination and the right resources, they are well-positioned to overcome their struggles and thrive in their new role as a web developer.</marquee>
